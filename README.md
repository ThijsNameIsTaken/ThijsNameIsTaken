## ðŸ™ƒ About me
I'm ThijsNameIsTaken, or Thijs for short. I live in The Netherlands and am following the college study Train Driver.

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
Mostly plugins for the game SCP: Secret Laboratory. Sometimes other random things.

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
Improving my C# knowledge.

## ðŸ’¬ Ask me about
Anything, but I might not be able to answer everything ðŸ˜‰

## ðŸ“« How to reach me:
My Discord is ~~ThijsNameIsTaken#5123~~ thijsnameistaken. Discord is the best platform to directly message me on, I almost never use Twitter, lol.

## âš¡ Fun fact:
I started programming when I was around 9 or 10 years old. Our school had (and still has) a public library and the librarian suggested programming to me.
