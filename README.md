## ðŸ™ƒ About me
I'm ThijsNameIsTaken, or Thijs for short. I live in The Netherlands and am in Dutch Middle-high school.

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
Probably too many things at once.

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
C# and maybe something else.

## ðŸ’¬ Ask me about
Anything, but I might not be able to answer everything ðŸ˜‰

## ðŸ“« How to reach me:
My Discord is ThijsNameIsTaken#5123, if you need something else go look it up on my [OMG.LOL page](https://thijs.omg.lol).

## âš¡ Fun fact:
I started programming when I was around 9 or 10 years old. Our school had (and still has) a public library and the librarian suggested programming to me.
